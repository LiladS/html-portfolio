<h1>About Me</h1>
  <p>I strated coding when I was younger, always praciticng for a bit but then neglecting it. 
    I started coding with python a year ago and then stopped to practice programming something, that would lead me to becoming a webdev.
  </p>
  <p>
    I love learning new things and am always looking for something new that interests me. I love coding as it has many different paths and things one can discover
    and continuously learn and build up on.
  </p>

  <p>I want to become a programmer and find a job that I can do from home. I also love drawing and writing stories and playing games. 
    I hope to find a way to combine all my interests at one point.
